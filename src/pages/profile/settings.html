            <p><strong>About: </strong>
                This app is meant to make sharing moments with your family simple, easy, and private.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                All you have to do is collect group codes from your family and friends, search each one and join that group! Then start sharing photos!
                <br/>
                <br/>
                There is a small ad that pops up when posting, if that annoys you or you want to support the app, feel free to
                buy the remove ads addon below, we really appreciate it!
                <br/>
                Also, we are constantly improving the app, feel free to give us feedback to let us know your concerns or thoughts.
                You can do this in the store by giving a rating and feedback.
